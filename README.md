**FDStatusBarNotifier** is a UIView subclass that lets you display notifications using the space in which the status bar resides.

# Installation

## Copy File
To use it just drag and drop `FDStatusBarNotifierView.h` and `FDStatusBarNotifierView.m` in your project, import the `.h` file in your view controller implementation and use the code shown in the example above.

## Cocoapods

You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage your dependencies and install *FDStatusBarNotifierView*.
Follow the instructions on the CocoaPods site to [install the gem](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods#installation) and add `pod 'FDStatusBarNotifierView', :git => 'https://github.com/frankdilo/FDStatusBarNotifierView.git'` to your *Podfile*.

# Use

It’s as easy to use as `UIAlertView`, here is an example:

	// from a view controller
	FDStatusBarNotifierView *notifierView = [[FDStatusBarNotifierView alloc] initWithMessage:@"Hi"];
	notifierView.timeOnScreen = 3.0;
	[notifierView showInWindow:self.view.window];


When you call `showInWindow:` the status bar disappear and the notifier view takes its place with a smooth animation.

## Manually hide

If can specify a `timeOnScreen` that automatically hide the notifier. You also have the ability to manualy hide it (e.g., in case of you use it for network activity), to do so you have to set the `timeOnScreen = kTimeOnScreenManuallyHide` and when your done you call `- hide:`.

## More

- If you set the `shouldHideOnTap` property to `YES` when the user touch the message it will be hidden.
- If the message you want to display doesn’t fit in the status bar it will be animated and scroll horizontally to display the full text.


## Optional delegate methods

I've also created some handy *self-explanatory* delegate methods, if you need them.

	- (void)willPresentNotifierView:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;  // before animation and showing view
	- (void)didPresentNotifierView:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;   // after animation
	- (void)willHideNotifierView:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;     // before hiding animation
	- (void)didHideNotifierView:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;      // after animation
	- (void)notifierViewTapped:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;       // user tap the status bar message

- [ZachOrr](https://github.com/ZachOrr): iPad support, hide on tap, better handling of device’s screen sizes.
- [dbsGen](https://github.com/dbsGen): if the message to display doesn’t fit in the status bar, it will scroll horizontally.
- [Luca Bernardi](https://github.com/lukabernardi): CocoaPods support.

## TO DO 

- Add support for multiple orientations (currently only portrait is supported).
- Properly manage the animation queue, to avoid unexpected behavior when `showInWindow:` is called multiple times.
