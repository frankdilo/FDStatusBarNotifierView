**FDStatusBarNotifier** is a UIView subclass that let you display notifications using the space in which the status bar resides.

Itâ€™s as easy to use as `UIAlertView`, here is an example:

	// from a view controller
	FDStatusBarNotifierView *notifierView = [[FDStatusBarNotifierView alloc] initWithMessage:@"Hi"];
	notifierView.timeOnScreen = 3.0;
	[notifierView showInWindow:self.view.window];


When you call `showInWindow:` the status bar disappear and the notifier view takes its place with a smooth animation.

# How to use it

To use it just drag and drop `FDStatusBarNotifierView.h` and `FDStatusBarNotifierView.m` in your project, import the `.h` file in your view controller implementation and use the code shown in the example above.

## Optional delegate methods

I've also created some handy *self-explanatory* delegate methods, if you need them.

	- (void)willPresentNotifierView:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;  // before animation and showing view
	- (void)didPresentNotifierView:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;   // after animation
	- (void)willHideNotifierView:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;     // before hiding animation
	- (void)didHideNotifierView:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;      // after animation
	- (void)notifierViewTapped:(FDStatusBarNotifierView *)notifierView;       // user tap the status bar message
